[00:00.36] Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up, girl?)
[00:03.64] Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
[00:07.79] Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
[00:11.49] 'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
[00:38.49] 
[00:15.73] I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
[00:18.10] Trying on all our clothes, clothes
[00:20.26] Boys blowing up our phones, phones
[00:23.59] Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
[00:26.27] Pulling up to the parties
[00:28.29] Trying to get a little bit tipsy
[00:44.29] 
[00:31.64] Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
[00:35.50] Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
[00:39.62] Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
[00:44.20] Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
[01:03.20]

[01:03.95] Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
[01:07.40] Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
[01:11.32] And now, the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
[01:15.62] But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
[01:46.12] 
[01:19.65] I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
[01:22.12] Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
[01:24.36] Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
[01:27.00] Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
[01:30.49] Or the police shut us down, down
[01:32.45] Police shut us down, down
[01:34.38] Po-po shut us
[01:40.88]

[02:04.34] Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
[02:23.34]

[02:10.68] You break me down
[02:12.72] My heart, it pounds
[02:14.62] Yeah, you got me
